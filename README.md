# Group-7-Sensitivities
# Production Sensitivity Analysis

This repository contains python files related to the sensitivity analysis conducted on various oil wells. 
The analysis aims to understand how different parameters affect well performance and optimize production strategies.

## Files

- **data.csv**: Contains the raw production data used for the sensitivity analysis.
- **analysis.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for the sensitivity analysis.
- **results.txt**: Text file containing the summarized results of the sensitivity analysis.

## Analysis Overview

The analysis investigates the impact of various factors such as reservoir pressure, wellhead pressure, gas-liquid ratio, water cut, and skin factor on oil production rates. 
Detailed insights and recommendations are provided based on the analysis results.

## Getting Started

To run the analysis locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `Group7-sensitivity.ipynb` notebook using Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment.
3. Run the cells in the notebook to perform the analysis.
4. Review the results in the `results.txt` file.
